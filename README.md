## 📍 Overview

Chessdom is a comprehensive chess web application built with Flask. It provides features such as user authentication and storage of games, puzzles for training tactics, a leaderboard to display rankings of the ELO, and a user-friendly interface for recording chess games. Chessdom allows its users to import games, navigate through their moves, and customize their board preferences. The project's goal is to offer users a platform to improve their skillset in tactics and strategy, as well as to provide a space for them to connect with other chess players.

## 💫 Features

Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **🏗 Structure and Organization** | The codebase is well-organized and follows a standard modular structure, with clear separation of concerns between the Flask app and its various components such as models and forms. The directories include "core," "static," and "templates" for keeping their respective code files, respectively. |
| **🧩 Dependency Management** | Dependencies are managed through a virtual environment separated from the central codebase and can be easily installed using the requirements.txt file available. |
| **♻️ Modularity and Reusability** | The code achieves a high level of reusability, especially with the usage of inheritance. The templates come with a "base.html" file that all other templates then extend which increases code reusability. |
| **🔒 Security Measures** | Certain limitations linked as requesting User data triggered SQL injection, data attached with debugging has imparted security risks. Password fields are salted and hashed, transporting passwords in non-encrypted transmission renders a security breach risk in practice. |
| **🔄 Version Control and Collaboration** | Version controlled with Git that maintains record of all modifications – commits performed. Detailed commit logs provide an insight into development progress and encourages team integration. |-Only these following columns that contains the analysis needed due to lack of information on other features.

The RegisterForm, LoginForm, SearchForm, GameForm, EditorForm and PreferenceForm contain a range of text inputs, select fields, password and file fields accompanied by data validation logic to ensure correct data types and input formats. The views utilizing these forms implement the backend logic required for desired website functionality.               | core/forms.py  |
| models.py | The code represents a Flask app with a database containing several tables (User, Game, Friend, Preference, Puzzle, PuzzleAttempted, PuzzleStats). The User table has methods for setting and checking password hashes. Other tables represent data about users, games, puzzles. Functions are defined for loading users, setting user avatars, and formatting model objects as strings. | core/models.py |
| routes.py | The routes.py file represents the core of the website, defining how the various pages and features interact with the user and handle requests and responses. The main features of the file are: management of the main pages, user authentication, user interaction, viewing and editing matches, management of preferences and rankings, and user search. | core/routes.py |
